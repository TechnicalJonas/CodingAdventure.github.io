Greetings fellow programmer

My name is Jonas Velasquez. I am currently studying and trying to change my career to be Software Engineer. 
This repository will a log for my projects while taking classes or practicing coding.

At the time of creating this repository I am currently participating in a bootcamp called Zero to Mastery. 

This is not pretty at first but I expect myself to keep updating it as I go on.

cheers :)
