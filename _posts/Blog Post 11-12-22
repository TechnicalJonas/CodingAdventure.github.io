## Blog Post #1

Today marks the first day I am starting using Github and my coding journey.
I am still pretty new to it so most of the time I will be looking up most of the stuff I am learning.

I am currently taking a Software Engineer course path and learning about HTML and CSS materials.
I am also learning about github as well and hopefully get better at it later. 

This is a basic blog (for me at least) but i could try to change it up later
