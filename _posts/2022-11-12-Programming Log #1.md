## Blog Post #1

Today marks the first day I am starting using Github and my coding journey.
I am still pretty new to it so most of the time I will be looking up most of the stuff I am learning.

# Formal Introduction:
My name is Jonas Velasquez. I am an Electrical Engineer who graduated from University of Illinois at Chicago. I not work as a Test Engineering at a manufacturing company. I felt like I did not like my current job and workplace. So I have decided to pursue and different career path.

# Why coding?
Even when i was still studying to be an Electrical Engineering. However, I could not focus both Electrical and Software while I was studying at UIC. To be honest, I really liked coding as a general. I like it that you will not stop learning new skills and practices as technology progresses. I also like the frustations whenever I'm stuck at some materials and eventually feel better once it makes sense. 

# How am I doing?
I am currently taking a Software Engineer course path and learning about HTML and CSS materials. I have also learned some Python programming.
I am fairly new to GitHub so it is something i need to get used to as I program

# My Goals:
- Software Engineering
- Cloud services
- Machine Learning

- transition from my current position

This is a basic blog (for me at least) but i could try to change it up later
